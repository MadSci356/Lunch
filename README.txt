This program will only be relevant to you if you are a High School student in Sioux Falls, SD. The local school district in sioux falls has website at http://www.sf.k12.sd.us , which has a calender with the lunch menu for a single month. So I decided to write a Python script that gets HTML source code from the website address with the lunch calender and parses it to get the lunch menu text. Simple. <EDIT MORE LATER>
